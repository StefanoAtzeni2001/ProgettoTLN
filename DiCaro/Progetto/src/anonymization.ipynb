      "On this occasion he failed to gain the support of the [[Loc1]] Miners ' [[Loc2]] and had to stand down. On both these occasions he was backed by the [[Loc1]] Miners ' [[Loc2]], but he was not successful. He also appeared as himself in the 1996 film \" [[Per1]] \". The [[Org1]] were created as an expansion franchise in 1993 and [[Loc3]] opened in 1995. He kept busy recording demo tapes at his home and working various jobs, including a position as a contracted security guard at the La [[Loc4]] in [[Loc5]] Jolla. included future [[Org2]] Against the [[Misc1]] and Audioslave drummer [[Per2]] [[Per3]]. Ten \" brought the band into the mainstream, and became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990 s, being certified 13x Platinum. ] ] Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, \" [[Misc2]] \", released in 1993. All of this greenery was fed with [[Loc6]] water diverted through the city ditch. He covered the [[Org3]] ' \" You 've [[Misc3]] to Hide Your Love Away \" for the \" I Am [[Per4]] \" soundtrack. The soundtrack was released on September 18, 2007 through J Records. \" He appears in the 2003 [[Org4]] documentary, \" End of the Century : The Story of the [[Org4]] \". In 2007, he made a cameo as himself in the comedy film, \" [[Misc4]] : The [[Per5]] \". All of the city 's seats in the state legislature are held by [[Org5]]. He also appears in the 2012 documentary \" [[Loc7]] of [[Loc8]] \", protesting against the case. He was like, \" Hey, welcome to [[Loc9]]. These guys [ the other members of [[Org6]] ] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound \". He also has paddled outrigger canoes on occasion and in 2005 was nearly lost at sea trying to paddle from Moloka'i to [[Loc10]]. At a rate of 19 homeless per 10,000 residents in 2011 as compared to 50 or more per 10,000 residents for the four metro areas with the highest rate of homelessness, [[Loc11]] 's homeless population and rate of homeless are both considerably lower than many other major cities. He attended Milligan College where he was an outstanding end and punter on the school 's football team. 281 in 1933 and played his last major league game on September 23, 1933, against the [[Org7]]. The following month, he signed a contract to play for the [[Loc12]] Bears in the [[Org8]]. He made a third appearance in a loss to [[Misc5]] at [[Loc13]], before being dropped for six matches. The city voted 53.5 percent in favor of the marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor [[Per6]] pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession in much the same way as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $ 100 and no jail time. He also played for several FA representative teams not officially described as \" [[Loc14]] \". He took charge of just one match, as [[Loc15]] were defeated 4 – 1 by neighbours and reigning gold medallists [[Loc16]] in the first round of the tournament. Returning to [[Loc17]], he told the press that he wanted to initiate a new playing style of \" long, sweeping passes \", and in addition to coaching the first team he also took charge of the youth team and coached at local [[Loc17]] schools. Despite his apparent unpopularity, he still managed to take the club to a second-place finish at the end of the 1953 – 54 season, one place ahead of [[Loc17]]. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. In response, Sunflowers forecast 500,000 sales by the end of 2006. This placed it second for 2006, behind \" World of [[Misc6]] \" at 345,000 units. The family spoke Judaeo-Spanish at home. It was not until about 1907 – 1909 that he produced his first paintings, which were portraits and nudes in a style influenced by [[Org9]] and Cézanne. [[Org10]] plans to offer ride-sharing, electric scooter and e-bike services all from its app. It says that it will, each night, take the scooters to the warehouse for safety checks, maintenance and charging. He made many drawings of street life in [[Loc18]], [[Loc19]], and other places he visited. Some of his works of 1915 and 1916 are in a [[Per7]] style, which he soon abandoned. [[Misc7]] in his bowler hat, he was a witty presence, along with his good friend Constant Detré, at [[Loc20]] Dôme Café, Jockey-Club de [[Loc21]], and the other haunts of the area 's bohemian society. A catalyst for even greater transformation of the area was the opening in June 2009 of the first segment of the [[Loc22]] linear park. Further development of a mountain corridor rail option, though publicly popular, has been met with resistance from politicians, namely the director of [[Org11]] of Transportation. On [[Misc8]], the film holds an approval rating of 67 % based on, with a weighted average rating of 5 / 10. By late May, however, he was back in the minors with the double A [[Org12]] after batting. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the [[Org13]]. 139 for the triple A [[Org14]]. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal / home computer. The match ended in 2 – 2 draw with [[Org15]]. In summer 2006, he was loaned to [[Org16]]. After an unsuccessful half-season, he was loaned to [[Loc23]]. In July 2008, he signed a 1 + 2-year contract with Foggia on free transfer. The first model ( launched June 1982 ) looked like the later [[Org17]] PC ( which came on the market years later ), a rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. On 19 July 2013 he was signed by [[Loc24]] in 1 + 1 year contract. He also scored once against former club [[Org18]] in promotion playoffs, losing 1 – 2. On 30 June 2014 he was signed by [[Org19]]. At the end of the season it is not confirmed, and accords with the [[Org20]]. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5 \" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened [[Misc9]] with a built-in keyboard. On 2 September 2019, he signed with Cavese. The music was composed and conducted by [[Per8]]. The film was originally released as a double feature with \" The [[Misc10]] of Horrors \". The film is in the public domain, and several DVD editions exist, including one by [[Org21]]. All units ran much faster than the original [[Misc11]], at 4 MHz, ( with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes ) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression ( video ram bus arbitration logic ), and an improved character font set. He developed coal mines on his wife 's land in [[Loc25]]. He saw service in 1794 in the [[Misc12]] of the [[Misc13]]. In all these terms as MP he supported the [[Org22]] interest. She was the 4th and youngest daughter of the 3rd Earl of Darnley. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, more than four times the capacity of the original [[Misc11]]. On 12 August 1822, his half-brother committed suicide He succeeded his half-brother as \" 3rd Marquess of [[Loc26]] \" in 1822. Lord [[Loc26]] used his new bride 's immense wealth to acquire the Seaham Hall estate in [[Loc25]] to developing the coalfields there. He also built the harbour at Seaham, to rival nearby [[Org23]]. It was completed by [[Per9]] in 1841 and cost £ 130,000 ( equivalent to £ 10,772,000 in 2016 ) to build and furnish. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for [[Misc11]] computers. During the tenant right campaign of the early 1850 s [[Loc26]] insisted on his full rights and this alienated many of his tenants. He was in disagreement over this question with his son and heir [[Per10]], who was more liberally inclined. He died on 6 March 1854 at [[Loc27]] and was buried in Longnewtown, [[Loc25]]. It has been a [[Org24]] brand since 1992. But these needed the infamous [[Misc11]] expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disc controller chip without an external \" data separator \". He won [[Misc14]] three times. He represented [[Loc28]] at the 2010 [[Misc15]]. In January 2003 he moved to Sartid [[Org25]]. [[Org26]] signed Mounir [[Loc29]] Hamdaoui as his successor. After designing their own fully functional replacement for the [[Misc11]] expansion interface ( which was never commercialized ) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. Her semi-autobiographical novel \" One True Thing \" ( 1994 ) served as the basis for the 1998 film starring [[Per11]] and [[Per12]]. In 1999, she joined \" [[Misc16]] \", writing a bi-weekly column until she announced her semi-retirement in the May 18, 2009, issue of the magazine. \" One True Thing \" was made into a feature film in 1998. In 1994, her semi-autobiographical novel, titled \" One True Thing \", was published. They observed that the [[Misc11]] was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. It can now be found on digital online streaming on Vudu and digital download on [[Misc17]]. It was the first all-black show to reach the [[Loc30]] stage in over a decade and included a young [[Per13]] among the performers. Fellow Belgian [[Per14]] had escaped to a solo victory. He won the race in [[Loc31]], after the leading six riders were caught. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, ( adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80 / 64 column text mode support, ( with different size letters for [[Misc11]] and CP / M mode, so that in [[Misc11]] mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64 × 16 portion of the 80 × 25 screen ) with an improved font set ( adding \" gray scale \" version of the [[Misc11]] mozaik graphics and many special [[Misc18]] like characters ), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements ), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, ( in the form of a 19-inch rack for the Eurocards ) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. However, he did not win a stage in the first week, beaten by [[Per15]] and [[Per16]]. In the Tour of [[Loc32]], he took on a defensive role when his teammate Stijn Devolder escaped and won. A week later, he outsprinted [[Per17]] and [[Per18]] in the final 500 m to win the [[Misc14]]. Its sporting director, Jean-René Bernaudeau, confirmed the report. A software engineer was hired to write the special \" dual boot mode \" BIOS and the special CP / M BIOS. In February 2009 a Belgian court found him guilty of cocaine use but decided against sanctions, saying he has \" been punished enough \". He returned to racing in the Eneco Tour where he won the third stage by beating [[Per19]] in the sprint. After that he entered the [[Misc19]] a [[Loc33]] to prepare for the final part of the season. He finished his season with a second place in [[Loc34]], beaten in a sprint of three by fellow countryman and defending champion [[Per20]]. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools. His third victory equalled those of Achiel Buysse, [[Per21]], [[Per22]] and [[Per14]]. He won the national championship title in June, taking the tricolor jersey from [[Per20]]. He did not take the start of [[Misc14]] when a fractured rib was diagnosed. His next feat came at Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, where he was part of a breakaway of 10 containing 4 of his teammates and 3 riders. Because of cash flow problems ( resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with [[Misc20]] processor deliveries ) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition. He was part of the lead-out train which helped teammate [[Per23]] take the win. She moved to [[Loc35]] in 1971, when her father entered politics to become Minister President of the state of Lower [[Loc36]] in 1976. In the late 1990 s, she became involved in local politics in the [[Loc35]] region, and she served as a cabinet minister in the state government of Lower [[Loc36]] from 2003 to 2005. Her father served as Minister President of Lower [[Loc36]] ( state prime minister ) from 1976 to 1990, being re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986. Finally a replacement for the aging [[Misc20]] processor was being developed in the form of an [[Org27]] 8086 board, and additional 512 K 16 bit memory boards. In 2001 she earned a Master of Public Health degree at the institution. She was a member of the committee on social policy of [[Org28]] in Lower [[Loc36]] from 1996, and also became active in the association of medical doctors in the [[Org28]] party. From 2003 to 2005 she was a minister in the state government of Lower [[Loc36]], serving in the cabinet of Christian [[Per24]], with responsibility for social affairs, women, family, and health. She later opposed the troop withdrawal from [[Loc37]]. In theory the system could support the [[Misc20]] and the 8086 simultaneously. The code of conduct for members of the [[Org29]] states that they \" shall abstain from making public statements or interventions on behalf of any political party or organization of the social partners of which they are members ”. In July 2009, she referred to the problems of struggling against paedophile pornography on the internet as the responsible persons often use servers located in [[Loc38]] or [[Loc39]], where, she said, \" child pornography is legal \". The Polish Foreign Minister made sarcastic comments about \" [[Misc21]] tone of the [[Misc22]] to [[Per25]] \". In March 2015, she and her counterparts from [[Loc40]] and [[Loc41]], [[Per26]] Drian and [[Per27]], revived a meeting format intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones by holding their first meeting between the [[Loc42]] defence ministers since 2007. Thus, it occupies a central place in Christian eschatology. One of these craters is filled by [[Loc43]] Avernus. In 1538, an eight-day eruption in the area deposited enough material to create a new hill, [[Loc44]] Nuovo. A 2009 journal article stated that inflation of the caldera centre near [[Loc45]] might presage an eruptive event within decades. The driving mechanism of the ground uplift changed to periodical emplacement of magma within a flat sill-shaped magmatic reservoir about in depth, south from the port of [[Loc45]]. The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor [[Per28]] ( AD 81 – 96 ), which evidence tends to confirm. [[Per29]] Flegrei is a blend of 50 – 70 % Piedirosso, 10 – 30 % Aglianico and / or Sciascinoso and up to 10 % of other local ( both red and white ) grape varieties. He returned after his three-month ban and got picked by the [[Loc46]] sevens team for the remainder of the 2006 – 07 IRB Sevens World Series. On 31 October, he again found the net, from a stunning free kick against [[Org30]] in a 2 – 0 home triumph where he received player of the match accolades. It was released on November 25, 1987, by [[Org31]] as the album 's seventh and final single. Over half of the references stem from [[Per30]], [[Per31]], [[Misc23]], and [[Misc24]], with [[Per30]] providing the largest number in proportion to length and [[Per31]] standing out as the most influential. In 2006, he briefly served as an assistant coach for the [[Loc47]] Cagerz, and in November, he was officially hired by the [[Per32]] ( of the USBL ), as head coach for the 2007 season. It is a homage to the city, shown in a series of loosely connected episodes set during both [[Loc48]] 's past and present. [[Per33]] recounts his youth in [[Loc48]]. Other attractions in [[Loc48]] are shown, including a cheap vaudeville theatre, streets, tunnels, and an ancient catacomb with frescos that get ruined by fresh air soon after the excavators discover it. This list mentions it as a part of the [[Misc25]] canon. During editing, a scene with [[Per34]] was cut because it was considered too immoral and cruel. The wartime scenes emphasize the congregation of neighbors in [[Loc48]] 's public places, such as street restaurants, a variety show, and a bomb shelter. The plot ( such as it is ) centers on two journeys to [[Loc48]] by the director. The second is as the director of a film crew creating a movie about [[Loc48]]. Various Christian anarchists, such as [[Per35]], have identified the State and political power as the Beast and the events described, being their doings and results, the aforementioned ' wrath '. He then worked as a lawyer for the [[Loc49]] Governor 's staff from 1965 - 67. Her mother was imprisoned in [[Loc50]] during [[Misc26]]. The family initially moved to [[Loc51]] but then emigrated to [[Loc52]] in 1952. She received her undergraduate degree from [[Org32]] and earned a doctorate in English literature from [[Org33]] in 1973. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with Greek drama. The so-constructed codebook also forms the so-called [[Per36]] manifold. Additionally, the song entered the revamped \" [[Org34]] \" Hot R&B [[Misc27]] & Tracks chart at number 23 with the mark of its seventh week on the chart, the issue date of January 9, 1999. During her [[Misc28]] in 1999, the song was performed as the second song of the tour setlist. In the [[Misc29]], iron is removed from mines in the crust and a portion re-deposited in waste repositories. These lists include compilation series of theatrical shorts such as \" The [[Misc30]] \" since they often feature some new wrap-around animation. He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother [[Per37]]. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but in time overcame his financial troubles with the help of [[Per38]]. His parents met when his father moved to Missouri. Slavery was legal in Missouri at the time, and it became a theme in these writings. What are now commonly known as 1Kings and 2Kings would be 3Kings and 4Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516, such as in the [[Misc31]] and the [[Misc32]]. working under a friend, the writer [[Per39]]. He may have been romantically involved with the poet [[Per40]]. He wrote a collection of travel letters which were later compiled as \" The [[Misc33]] \" ( 1869 ). They had three daughters : Susy ( 1872 – 1896 ), [[Per41]] ( 1874 – 1962 ), and [[Per42]] ( 1880 – 1909 ). The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version. He began a friendship with the financier in 1893, a principal of Standard Oil, that lasted the remainder of his life. [[Per43]] 's death in 1904 and [[Per42]] 's on December 24, 1909, deepened his gloom. He expressed a preference for cremation ( for example, in \" Life on the [[Loc53]] \" ), but he acknowledged that his surviving family would have the last word. His next large-scale work was \" [[Per44]] \", which he wrote rapidly, as he was desperately trying to stave off bankruptcy. Deuterium was discovered and named in 1931 by [[Per45]]. He supported the labor movement, especially one of the most important unions, the [[Loc54]] of Labor. At other times, he wrote or spoke in ways that contradicted a strict deist view, for example, plainly professing a belief in [[Loc55]]. The anti-religious \" The Mysterious Stranger \" was published in 1916. In 1900 and again in 1908 he stated, \" I like \" [[Per46]] of [[Loc56]] \" best of all my books, it is the best \". [[Org35]] allows both D and, although is preferred. She has also appeared in the later-released \" Compilation of Final Fantasy VII \" and \" [[Misc34]] \" series. She also appears in \" [[Misc35]] \" as a perceptive figment of [[Misc36]] 's memories. Fans submitted a petition to [[Per47]] requesting her return. \" [[Misc37]] \" considers her death sequence to be the greatest of all gaming moments. The differences are much more pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and [[Per48]] spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly higher than that of protium. Rhodamine B is used in biology as a staining fluorescent dye, sometimes in combination with auramine O, as the auramine-rhodamine stain to demonstrate acid-fast organisms, notably \" Mycobacterium \". The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth 's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by \" [[Misc38]] \", which has led it to be compared to genres like Roguelikes or dungeon-crawlers. \" [[Misc39]] \" found the game addictive and original, but found fault with its slow-paced combat. Deuterium, however, benefits from having its proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger nuclear attraction ; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the [[Per49]] exclusion principle which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin to have some other different quantum number, such as orbital angular momentum. \" [[Misc40]] \" said that it was \" An [[Org36]] game, but one which becomes completely essential when played with someone else. \" [[Misc41]] \" praised the \" absolutely hilarious \" sound effects and music. [[Misc42]] felt that the game 's 1990 s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay - particularly the two-player mode - was still enjoyable by modern standards. [[Misc43]] 's reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow. It was first detected spectroscopically in late 1931 by [[Per45]], a chemist at [[Org37]]. They used the [[Loc57]] as a major route to the northwest, with a mountain portage around the falls. She enters the [[Misc44]] camp along the [[Loc57]] and, pretending to be lost, she bargains with them to spare her life if she will bring them to her father 's camp. The most famous painting featuring the falls, painted by [[Per50]] in 1882, is held by the [[Loc58]] of [[Loc59]]. For his services in representing the [[Loc60]] in a number of international legal arbitrations he was appointed GCMG in 1904, and the following year became a Privy Counsellor. During [[Misc26]], [[Org38]] was known to be conducting experiments using heavy water as moderator for a nuclear reactor design. it is a love song about being together, and was sung in a duet by [[Per51]] and [[Per52]]. The song was at Svensktoppen for nine weeks during the period 20 April-31 August 1980. On 4 May 1980, \" Mycke ' mycke ' mer \" for first time reached the top position at Svensktoppen. Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using [[Per53]] 's razor. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that a signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency component in the signal. The novel was later illustrated with a series of linocuts by [[Per54]], the foremost Belgian modernist painter and engraver. The novel follows many historic events in the Eighty Years ' War. He exults with the growing success of the revolt, following the Capture of Brielle in 1572. [[Misc45]] comics artist [[Per55]] Raemdonck adapted the novel into a comic strip in 1964. In practice, the sampling frequency is often significantly higher than twice the [[Per56]] frequency. In the 1994 – 95 season, after a short two-game stint in the Swedish junior league, he totalled 10 goals and 7 assists in 29 games for the parent club. In season 1996 – 97, he played with Kiekko-Espoo of the [[Org39]], scoring 24 goals and adding 19 assists in 50 games. He would not return to play in [[Loc61]] for three years as he left for [[Loc62]]. To gain more experience, he joined the [[Org40]] and split the 1999 – 2000 season with the [[Org41]] and the Long Beach Ice Dogs, notching 32 points in 37 games and earning rookie of the year honors. The Fourier transform converts the time or space information to a magnitude and phase component of each frequency. However, he started to click on a line with [[Per57]] and [[Per58]], and he responded by scoring 29 points in his next 23 games, including a four-game span when he had three four-point games. He was forced to sit out for three months before he could return to the ice and made his comeback against the [[Loc63]] Senators on March 6 and had four penalty minutes and - 1, logging nearly 8 minutes of ice time. Next season, he signed with SKA [[Loc64]] in the newly formed [[Org42]]. In 2006, he played on loan in [[Org43]]. Where phase is unimportant, often the Fourier transform is converted to the power spectrum, which is the magnitude of each frequency component squared. He is the brother of [[Per59]]. He soon gained notice in [[Loc65]] for his versatility in composing jazz, piano, and symphonic music. In 2006, \" [[Misc46]] \" was directed by [[Per60]], best known for directing the first two films in the \" [[Misc47]] \" series. In 1995 he was succeeded by [[Per61]], the former associate conductor of the [[Org44]] and [[Org45]]. The Z-transform provides a tool for analyzing stability issues of digital IIR filters. These featured a tribute to the musicals of film director [[Per62]], and had the distinction of serving as the [[Org46]] season 's opening event. Similarly, his film music has clear influences from other classical and film composers, including Holst, [[Per63]], Korngold, and others. 1958 ), and [[Per64]] ( b. This led to a trial with [[Misc5]] during the winter of 1992. It is analogous to the [[Per65]] transform, which is used to design and analyze analog IIR filters. While he started both games, he did not gain another cap until he came on for [[Per66]] in a 2 – 2 tie with [[Loc66]] on January 30, 1993. He graduated to Formula 3000 with [[Loc7]] Competition for 1998, but failed to impress whilst his teammate [[Per67]] mounted a strong challenge for overall honours. He is currently head coach and general manager of the [[Org47]]. He was then offered a job as an assistant coach for the [[Loc59]] men 's national team. After about ten years, the two sons of [[Per68]] also died in [[Misc48]] ( 1:4 ). The album cover also resembles the cover of the film, \" King of [[Loc67]] \". After the first expeditions were long forgotten, Father [[Per69]] rediscovered the [[Loc68]] peninsula in 1701. In August 2004, \" [[Misc49]] \" at [[Loc69]] broke the record with 32 riders. The roller coaster was prominently featured in an episode of \" The Inbetweeners \". [[Per68]] decided to return to [[Loc70]]. He then later took on Assistant Coach role for Waitakere [[Loc71]]. After a short stint with the [[Org48]], he became the starting point guard for the [[Org49]], with whom he won two more championships. and missed the 1977 [[Misc50]], leading head coach [[Per70]] to resign. He campaigned unsuccessfully for the [[Misc51]] nomination in in 1984, 1990, and 1998. Orpah reluctantly left ; however, [[Per71]] said, \" Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back and not follow you. The transformation into a real sport happened independently in [[Loc72]] and [[Loc73]]. In 2011, she appeared on \" [[Misc52]] \" in comedic skits with [[Per72]] and [[Per73]]. [[Per74]] said that a full recovery was likely, but that she would miss some concerts. The title 's name was partially inspired by the sales success of \" [[Misc53]] \" and \" [[Misc54]] \". ( [[Per75]] – 17 NJPS ). He was traded, along with [[Per76]], [[Per77]] and [[Misc55]], to the [[Org50]] for [[Per78]] and Pete Richert in the offseason. It would not be until he signed with the [[Org51]] during the 1983 season, after being released by the [[Org7]], that he would return to form. Still, the [[Org52]] finished with one of the worst records in the western conference, with a record of 29 – 53. His apparent ADHD affected his play in high school, and he took Ritalin to treat the condition. The two women returned to [[Loc70]] at the beginning of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, [[Per71]] went to the fields to glean. In his residence in Marcinelle, he constructed a concealed dungeon in the basement. Later investigations showed that four police men in [[Loc74]] were also members of the sect, one was even the treasurer. The assassination of [[Per79]] took place in 1991. He resided in Zeebrugge until his death on 23 October 2019. [[Per68]] sent [[Per71]] to the threshing floor at night and told her to go where he slept, and \" uncover his feet and lie down. The film stars [[Per80]], [[Per81]], [[Per82]] and [[Per83]], and features [[Per84]] in her final film role. Its plot follows the insomniac wife of a wealthy [[Loc75]] psychoanalyst who, after a chance meeting with a hypnotist, is charged with a violent murder. Between 1969 and 1984 he was capped 102 times for East [[Loc72]], scoring 55 goals. Aside from exclusive season two star [[Per85]] ( of \" [[Misc56]] \" fame ), the second season also featured the first onscreen appearance of [[Per86]]. Ruth did so. He joined fellow Australians [[Per87]], [[Per88]] and then-teammate [[Per89]] in the squad. He managed to play a total of 14 league games, conceding 16 goals and making 5 clean sheets as [[Loc76]] were relegated at the end of the season. In spite of the legislation, tobacco sponsorship continues in the sports through electronic cigarettes, with companies such as [[Org53]] Smoke, blu ( owned by R. [[Per90]] ), and [[Misc57]] sponsoring [[Org54]] teams. [[Misc58]] changes are allowed during road course weekends and during the race weekends at [[Loc77]]. The women of the city celebrate [[Per68]] 's joy, for [[Per68]] found a redeemer for her family name, and [[Per68]] takes the child and places it in her bosom. At tracks shorter than 1.25 miles ( tracks shorter than [[Loc78]] ), the best two timed laps will set the starting lineup. The session results from single car qualifying set the starting lineups for the [[Org55]] Duel races on Thursday. This proved disastrous for [[Per91]] in 2007, as he moved to a fledgling [[Org56]] with no owner points and failed to qualify in 12 races after being forced to use all of his past champion 's provisionals at the start of the season. Tire supplier [[Org57]] is allowed unlimited testing and can ask whichever teams it wants to complete the test. The child is named Obed, who we discover is \" the father of [[Per92]], the father of [[Per93]] \" ( [[Per94]] – 17 ), that is, the grandfather of King [[Per93]]. The [[Org54]] [[Org58]] Series will run practice on Friday, followed by qualifying a few hours before the race on Saturday. Production was intended at three factories located in [[Loc79]], [[Loc80]], and [[Loc81]] with ancillary items coming from several other factories. [[Loc82]] were produced at IMZ in Irbit from 1942 until 1955. He became a first team regular in 2005 – 06, and attracted a bid from [[Org23]], rejected by then-manager [[Per95]], who said he was unwilling to part with one of his players he considered a hot prospect. A substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the [[Misc59]] period ( 6th – 4th centuries BC ). He was first called up by the [[Loc14]] under-21 squad in November 2007 for the 2009 European Championship qualifiers, however he was an unused substitute in the games. He later received a second call-up from the under-21 s when he was selected for a European Championship qualifier against [[Loc83]] in September 2008. However, he was again an unused substitute in the game, and again in the qualifying play-offs against [[Loc84]] in October 2008. The song was written by [[Per96]] and Torgny Söderberg. Concerning this, the [[Misc60]] says that only male Moabites are banned from the congregation. At first, it was thought that [[Per97]] should sing this song at [[Misc61]] 1996. At Svensktoppen, the song stayed for 5 weeks, 20 April-18 May 1996, with a 3rd place as best result there. The [[Per97]] version is on her 2006 album \" Lady Star \". [[Loc9]] also became an important stop for vaudeville tours, put on by large chains like Pantages and Considine ; the city also produced a major attraction in the exotic dancer [[Misc62]]. Scholars have increasingly explored [[Per71]] in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues. Though most of the regionally important bands in the 1960 s were dominated by white men, [[Loc9]] also produced a few female country rock performers, most notably [[Per98]] and Bonnie Guitar. There is also a significant feminist punk scene in [[Loc9]], led by bands such as TacoCat and Childbirth. There are four genera of mosquitoes that transmit dirofilariasis, [[Misc63]], Culex, Anopheles, and [[Misc64]]. The inflammation occurring at the die-off of adult heartworms or larvae is in part due to the release of \" Wolbachia \" bacteria or protein into the tissues. \" Discordianism \" is a paradigm based upon the book \" [[Misc65]] Discordia, \" written by [[Per99]] with [[Per100]] Thornley in 1963, the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and [[Per101]] Ravenhurst. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. Selamectin ( Revolution ) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly, and can also be used to control fleas, ticks, and mites. Queen [[Per102]] I ( [[Per103]] ) owes money to Santángel. Four years later, [[Per104]] cuts the hand off one of the natives, accusing him of lying about the whereabouts of gold. Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion, although some of its adherents may utilize it as a legitimate religion or as a metaphor for a governing philosophy. She agrees to let him take a final voyage, with the proviso that he does not go with his brothers nor returns to [[Loc85]] or the other colonies. [[Per105]] is a filmmaker celebrated for dramatic and action sequences by dazzling visual imagery. He plays as a midfielder for Virtus [[Loc86]]. He started his professional career at [[Org59]], giant of [[Loc87]]. The \" [[Misc65]] Discordia \", if read literally, encourages the worship of the Greek goddess [[Loc88]], known in [[Misc66]] as Discordia, the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. The July 8, 2016 is presented as a new purchase of [[Org60]]. On 23 July 2019, he signed with [[Loc89]]. He was born in Hoshiarpur, [[Loc90]], and is considered the fastest pre-independence Indian pace bowler. He immigrated to [[Loc91]] in 1947 and died in [[Loc92]] in 1963. Both views are supported by the \" [[Misc65]] Discordia \". He made his league debut playing a full 90 minutes against [[Org61]]. He is well remembered for his stunning performance against [[Org62]]. [[Org63]] went on to win the game in penalties, giving them their first title in 16 years. He did not play in any of [[Loc93]] 's four games. Due to these principles, a [[Per106]] believes there is no distinction between order and disorder, since they are both man-made conceptual divisions of the pure element of chaos. He was replaced in the squads by [[Per107]]. On 12 June 2015, he played all 90 minutes against [[Loc94]] in a 0 – 0 draw. He was later named captain of the squad for the remainder of the tournament after [[Per108]] suffered an injury. On review aggregator website [[Misc8]], the film has a rating of 64 % based on 182 reviews. It is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system, and because, by nature of the system itself, there is an encouragement to form schisms and cabals. In January 2012, [[Loc95]] bought [[Loc96]] 's half to end their search for a goalkeeper since the summer of 2011. In a separate deal, the transfer fee would partially compensate for the signing of [[Per109]] from [[Loc95]] to [[Loc96]] outright. He was a part of the Italian squad that took part at the 2007 [[Misc67]]. On 13 May 2012, he was included in [[Per110]] 's 32-man provisional squad for [[Misc68]] 2012 ; however, he was later excluded from the final 23-man team on 28 May. The foundational document of Discordianism is the \" [[Misc65]] Discordia \", fourth edition, written by Malaclypse the Younger, an alias of [[Per99]]. He was mostly remembered at the side for his pin-point assists and ability to cross the ball, mainly to the head of Mário Jardel. Eventually, he could not help prevent them from dropping down a level after a 4 – 1 loss to [[Org64]] on 17 May. He went on to play a further 37 times in the following five years, appearing for the nation at the 1998 [[Misc15]] and [[Misc68]] 2000 tournaments and contributing with one goal in the 3 – 3 group stage draw against [[Loc97]] and four assists in the latter as the country reached the quarter-finals. A \" kommanditselskab \" ( ; abbreviated K / S ) is the [[Misc69]] equivalent of the limited partnership. Included in the \" [[Misc65]] Discordia \" is an official pope card that may be reproduced and distributed freely to anyone and everyone. In [[Misc69]] tax law a K / S is not taxable and does thus not pay corporation taxes. The film was an adaptation by director [[Per111]] and screenwriter [[Per112]] of the 1949 novel by [[Per113]]. It was backed by the major film studio [[Org65]], where it was green-lighted by production chief Dore Schary, over the objections of studio head [[Per114]]. However, his first senior appearance came in a loan spell at [[Org66]]. He is honoured as a saint within Discordianism for living his life according to truth as he saw it and a disregard for reality as others would perceive it. The series was devised by [[Per115]], who had already enjoyed success with another police drama series, \" [[Per116]] \". From the third series onward, studio scenes were recorded at the [[Org67]] 's [[Misc70]] [[Per117]] Studios in [[Loc98]]. Exterior scenes were filmed in the [[Loc99]] towns of Colne, Bacup, [[Loc100]], [[Per118]], [[Org68]], and in Todmorden, [[Loc101]]. Other locations around east [[Loc99]], [[Loc101]] and the Black Country ( Tipton and [[Per119]] ) were also used. The hand of [[Loc88]] ( shown at right ) and other proposed symbols are used informally in certain circles ; however, it is unlikely that [[Loc88]], the [[Loc102]] dwarf planet, will be assigned an official symbol by the [[Org69]], since graphical symbols are rarely assigned to minor objects in modern times. These were authored by [[Per120]]. His career, highly troubled by injuries, was mainly spent at [[Org70]], where he also later worked as a manager. However, in March 2008 he replaced [[Per121]] Camacho after the Spaniard was dismissed. \" [[Misc71]] \" gave the game a positive review, noting improvements in the presentation and action sequences over its predecessors. Having been snubbed, [[Loc88]] creates a golden apple with the word \" kallisti \" (, to the prettiest one ) inscribed in it. [[Per122]] and [[Per123]] had worked together on \" Judgment at [[Loc103]] \" in 1961. Konkani Muslims speak a variety of dialects of [[Misc72]] collectively called [[Misc73]]. He came to [[Loc59]] in 1987. He was shot down two weeks later and spent six years in captivity in [[Loc104]] as a prisoner of war. This interpretation would see [[Loc88]] as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests ' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding. He then served as a State Senator in [[Loc105]]. Law firms operating in multiple countries often have complex structures involving multiple partnerships, particularly in jurisdictions such as [[Loc106]] and [[Loc107]] which restrict partnerships between local and foreign lawyers. The oldest continuing partnership in the [[Loc108]] is that of Cadwalader, Wickersham & [[Per124]], founded in 1792, in [[Loc109]]. This can be compared with $ 404 billion for the world 's largest firm by turnover [[Org71]] and $ 28 billion for the largest professional services firm [[Org72]]. [[Per106]] works include a number of books, not all of which actually exist. [[Misc74]] firms typically practise [[Loc110]]. Salary levels are lower in areas outside [[Loc111]]. At top-tier firms in [[Loc110]], salaries of lawyers who have been admitted to practice range from $ 75,000 to $ 92,000 and partners make on average $ 1,215,000. She had a top 10 [[Loc112]] hit in every one of the last five decades, and sang lead on a top 75 hit single at least once every year from 1964 to 1996 in the [[Loc112]], a period of 33 consecutive years and a record for any performer. The collaborators stated that \" while the original \" [[Misc65]] Discordia \" holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. That year, the group recorded two tracks for [[Loc113]] Pine Records, with [[Per125]] singing lead on one of the tracks. During the group 's early years, [[Per125]] served as hairstylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. Eventually, Janie [[Loc114]] approached [[Per126]], the only group member at the studio at the time, to pick out a new name for the group. The group appeared as a trio of singing nuns in a 1968 episode of the popular [[Org73]] TV series \" [[Misc75]] \". Among these women is a Jewish orphan named [[Per127]], who was raised by her cousin or uncle, [[Per128]] ( 2:5 – 7 ). In May 1970, [[Per125]] released her eponymous solo debut, which included her signature songs, \" [[Misc76]] Out and [[Misc77]] ( Somebody 's Hand ) \" and \" Ai n't No Mountain High Enough \", the latter becoming [[Per125]] ' first number-one solo single., which included the [[Loc115]] 5. In 1973, [[Per125]] had her second number-one hit with the ballad \" [[Misc78]] in the Morning \". A year later, in 1976, [[Per125]] released her fourth solo number-one hit, \" [[Misc79]] \", a sensual, dramatic mid-tempo song that bursts into an uptempo disco tune. She finds favour in the King 's eyes, and is crowned his new queen, but does not reveal her Jewish heritage ( 2:8 – 20 ). This concert special is noted for its opening, during which [[Per125]] literally makes her entrance through a movie screen. In 1980, [[Per125]] released her most successful album to date, \" [[Per129]] \". [[Org74]] offered [[Per125]] a $ 20 \" million, seven-year recording contract, which gave her complete production control of her albums. At the time, [[Per125]] 's was music history 's most expensive recording deal. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and [[Per128]] 's service to the King is recorded ( 2:21 – 23 ). Ross 's second film, \" [[Misc80]] \", was released in 1975. The story of an aspiring fashion designer who becomes a runway model and the toast of the industry, \" [[Misc80]] \" was a troubled production from its inception. The film 's original director, [[Per130]], was fired during production, and [[Per131]] [[Per132]] assumed the director 's chair himself. Though pre-release television broadcast rights had been sold to [[Org75]] for over $ 10 \" million, the film produced a net loss of $ 10.4 \" million for [[Org76]] and Universal. [[Per128]], who sits at the palace gates, falls into [[Per133]] 's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him ( 3:2 – 5 ). Three years later, [[Per125]] and [[Per134]] had a modest dance hit with their recording of \" Ease on [[Misc81]] the Road \". In 1993, [[Per125]] returned to acting with a dramatic role in the television film, \" Out of [[Misc82]] \". On May 6, 1982, [[Per125]] was honored with a star on the [[Loc116]]. In 1983, [[Per125]] ventured further out of her earlier soul-based sound for a more pop rock-oriented sound following the release of the \" [[Per125]] \" album. When [[Per128]] discovers the plan, he goes into mourning and implores [[Per127]] to intercede with the King ( 4:1 – 5 ). Ross tried to continue performing, but, the severe weather required that the show be stopped after 45 minutes. Ross urged the large crowd to exit the venue safely, promising to perform the next day. The [[Per135]] Playground was built three years later. Ross returned the next year to host the 14th annual telecast. She invites him to a feast in the company of [[Per133]] ( 5:3 – 5 ). Ross accepted the offer. Subsequent releases, such as \" The [[Org77]] Behind the Power \" ( 1991 ), \" [[Misc83]] Higher \" ( 1995 ), and \" Every Day Is a New Day \" ( 1999 ) produced similar results. Ross 's albums achieved more international than domestic success. \" The [[Org77]] Behind the Power \" sparked an international comeback of sorts when the album went double platinum in the [[Loc112]]. Meanwhile, [[Per133]] is again offended by [[Per128]] and, at his wife 's suggestion, has a gallows built to hang him ( 5:9 – 14 ). The retrospective was [[Org78]] 's alternative to [[Org76]] 's box set \" [[Misc84]] : Musical [[Misc85]] \". On January 28, 1996, [[Per125]] performed the halftime show at [[Misc86]] XXX. [[Per136]] would soon succeed [[Per125]] as the most successful female artist in the [[Loc112]]. Later that year, [[Per125]] presented at the 1999 [[Misc87]] in September of the year and shocked the audience by touching rapper [[Per137]] ' [[Per138]] 's exposed breast, pasty-covered nipple, amazed at the young rapper 's brashness. He is reminded that [[Per139]] in the previous plot against his life, and discovers that [[Per128]] never received any recognition ( 6:2 – 3 ). Ross agreed. The tour 's final performance was at [[Loc109]] 's [[Loc117]]. It peaked at number two on \" [[Org34]] \" s jazz albums chart. In 2010, [[Per125]] embarked on her first headlining tour in three years titled the \" More Today Than [[Misc88]] : The Greatest Hits Tour \". To his surprise and horror, the King instructs [[Per133]] to do so to [[Per128]] ( 6:10 – 11 ). The event was later broadcast as an annual special on TNT. In February 2016, [[Per125]] resumed her In the Name of Love Tour, which began in 2013. In December 2016, \" [[Org34]] magazine \" named her the 50th most successful dance club artist of all time. Ross performed several of her hits, ending with \" Ai n't No Mountain High Enough \", during which she brought all of her grandchildren onstage. The King promises to grant her any request, and she reveals that she is Jewish and that [[Per133]] is planning to exterminate her people, including her ( 7:1 – 6 ). Ross dated [[Per140]], bass guitarist and singer for the band [[Misc89]], from 1980 to 1983. Ross remains close with her three ex-stepchildren. [[Per135]] considers herself a [[Misc90]]. [[Per129]] and her siblings spent considerable time with their maternal grandparents during their mother 's bouts with tuberculosis. The King returns in at this very moment and thinks [[Per133]] is assaulting the queen ; this makes him angrier and he orders [[Per133]] hanged on the very gallows that [[Per133]] had prepared for [[Per128]] ( 7:8 – 10 ). Several of [[Per125]] 's songs have been covered and sampled. The song has also been covered live and on albums by [[Per141]], [[Per142]]. \" [[Org76]] : The Musical \" is a [[Loc30]] musical that launched on April 14, 2013. They were inducted into the Rock and [[Misc91]] Hall of [[Misc92]] in 1988, received a star on the [[Loc116]] in 1994, and entered into the Vocal Group Hall of [[Misc92]] in 1998. On 13 [[Misc93]], [[Per133]] 's ten sons and 500 other men are killed in Shushan ( 9:1 – 12 ). After her 1983 concert in [[Loc118]], [[Per135]] Playground was named in her honor with a groundbreaking opening ceremony in 1986. Ross was given credit for the discovery of the [[Loc115]] 5. Her \" discovery \" was simply part of [[Org76]] 's marketing and promotions plan for the [[Loc115]] 5. Consequently, their debut album was titled \" Diana Ross Presents the [[Loc115]] 5 \". Upon hearing of this [[Per127]] requests it be repeated the next day, whereupon 300 more men are killed ( 9:13 – 15 ). He has been capped once for [[Loc41]]. On 20 April 2005, he made his league debut in a 2 - 2 draw against [[Org79]]. However, he rarely featured in the first team as Krzysztof Kotorowski took the goalkeeping position. After six months at [[Per143]], he joined Korona [[Loc119]]. [[Per128]] and [[Per127]] send letters throughout the provinces instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people 's redemption, in a holiday called [[Misc94]] ( lots ) ( 9:20 – 28 ). He debuted for [[Loc41]] in a friendly versus [[Loc120]] in February 2009. In 1881, [[Per144]] and [[Per145]] observed that this sucker \" occurs in [[Loc121]] in numbers which are simply enormous \" ; the population seems to have boomed and crashed several times since then. Taxonomic nomenclature for this species is disputable, with \" Catostomus ardens \" in [[Loc121]] being confused with the June sucker, \" Chasmistes liorus \", and the name \" Catostomus fecundus \" being used for a time. He signed for [[Org80]] in January 2013. These letters were distinguished in at least three ancient [[Misc95]] manuscripts in red. They are found in [[Loc122]], [[Loc123]], [[Loc124]], [[Loc125]], [[Loc91]], [[Loc37]], and [[Loc126]]. Many [[Misc96]] also remember that the country experienced some of its best moments under German kings over a century ago. However, on 15 October President [[Per146]] nominated [[Per147]], a top [[Misc97]] economist, as Prime Minister, and charged the latter with forming the country 's next government. In the meeting of 28 June 2014, he was elected President of the [[Org81]] with 95 % of the votes. This contrasts with traditional Jewish commentaries, such as the commentary of the [[Loc127]] Gaon, which states \" But in every verse it discusses the great miracle. \" On the same day, the draft was rejected in the Senate, with both [[Org81]] 's and [[Org82]] 's senators voting in favour of the rejection. The president 's comments were also criticised by members of the [[Misc97]] opposition parties [[Org82]] and [[Org83]], but also by the confidence and supply USR ( which has been supporting the [[Org81]] minority government since 2019 ). Making one of its important position was in 25 February 2016 at the annual meeting of the [[Org84]] : “ From year to year the work of the [[Org84]] has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. Through the work and achievements, you 've earned the appreciation of the [[Misc97]] citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. Although marriages between [[Misc98]] and [[Per148]] are not permitted in orthodox [[Misc99]], even in case of Pikuach nefesh, [[Per127]] is not regarded as a sinner, because she remained passive, and risked her life to save that of the entire Jewish people. \" [[Misc100]] \" gave the game 32 out of 40. After winning the contest, [[Per149]] performed the reprise in four different languages : German, English, French and Dutch. She later released recordings in five additional languages across [[Loc61]] : [[Misc69]], Italian, Russian, and a German-English-Dutch combination and a German-English-Italian combination. Although [[Per149]] was not at the concert, it was re-enacted by dancers equipped with white guitars and a live orchestra as the original footage was shown in the background. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of [[Per128]], and nothing of [[Per127]] 's own words is ever used. With the lockout in effect, he was directly assigned to the [[Org85]] affiliate, the [[Org86]]. As the best rated [[Loc128]] player in run-chases in ODI history, he is often regarded as one of the most innovative ODI batsmen of all time. He is an aggressive right-hand batsman who invented the scoop, which has come to be known as the [[Misc101]], a shot that hits the ball over the keeper. He is the fourth [[Loc128]], and eleventh player overall to score 10,000 ODI runs. The team played its home games at Atlanta–Fulton [[Loc129]] from 1966 to 1996, and at [[Loc130]] from 1997 to 2016. He scored 9 runs on his debut and was out LBW to a delivery off [[Per150]]. He scored an unbeaten 163 runs in the first innings and was awarded the player of the match award for his role in the [[Loc128]] victory. His maiden ODI century came against [[Loc131]] on July 4, 2006, where he smashed an unbeaten 117 runs along with Sanath Jayasuriya 's 157 to help [[Loc132]] post then highest ODI score of 443 runs, which stood for 10 years until [[Loc14]] scored 444 runs. His 150 runs came off 115 balls with [[Loc132]] on the brink of a sensational win. From 1991 to 2005, the [[Org87]] were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times ( omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions ), and producing one of the greatest pitching rotations in the history of baseball. However, by 2007, he was selected to open the batting with Sanath Jayasuriya in ODI game against [[Loc39]], where he started to showcase himself as an attacking and threatening opening batsman. Until retirement, he slotted as the permanent opening batsman for [[Loc132]], as well as operating as a handy right-arm off-break bowler in both ODI and T20I matches. In 2012, he was ranked the second-highest ODI run scorer, with 1119 runs, behind his teammate [[Per151]]. With this, he became the fourth [[Loc128]] and eleventh overall to achieve the milestone. Most notably, this rotation consisted of pitchers [[Per152]], [[Per153]], and [[Per154]]. He has been known to video bomb fellow players such as [[Per155]] [[Per156]]. He is the second [[Loc128]] and fifth overall to achieve international centuries in all forms of the game. The film is based on the true story of [[Per157]], an [[Org88]] agent convicted of spying for the [[Loc133]] and later [[Loc134]] for more than two decades. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the [[Org88]] and complains that only those who regularly \" shoot guns \" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. [[Org89]] advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990 s ( 1991, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1999 ), winning the title in 1995 against the [[Org13]]. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the [[Org73]] television series \" The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air \", which ran for six seasons from 1990 to 1996. Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Org90]] and [[Per158]]. [[Org91]] \" was released on February 27, 2015. Instead, the role went to [[Per159]]. [[Org89]] are the only [[Org92]] franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. A \" mehmaan khana \" ( [[Misc102]] مہمان خانہ, मेहमान ख़ाना, ) is a drawing room where guests are entertained in many houses in North [[Loc39]], [[Loc135]] and [[Loc91]]. These rooms were a typical feature of many Mughal era havelis palaces and mansions in the region. In [[Loc135]], it is more commonly known as \" baithak ghar \" or \" bangla ghar \" ( ). The term \" hujra \" is especially prevalent in the predominantly [[Misc103]] areas of [[Loc91]]. The [[Org93]], established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Having initially said he would consider carefully whether to accept, he later announced his decision to play for [[Loc136]]. The series has presented numerous acclaimed British productions. She had planned to attempt to qualify for the 10-kilometre open water event at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but this event was removed from the competition. The architect was [[Per160]] ( 1844 – 1920 ), who had already built, among other things, the [[Loc137]] of [[Loc138]]. For most of that time, their manager was [[Per161]]. It is located in the Denderstreek and at the edge of the [[Loc139]] [[Loc140]], the hilly southern part of the province of East [[Loc32]] ( [[Loc141]] ). When [[Org75]] canceled \" The Skatebirds \" in early 1978, the trio was given their own half-hour timeslot which ran for 16 episodes. The concept was particularly important during the [[Misc104]] period when a number of states were divided on ideological grounds. To that end, it claimed [[Loc142]], capital of united [[Loc72]] from 1871 to 1945, as its capital, with the provisional capital in [[Loc143]]. The team became the \" [[Org87]] \" for the first time before the 1912 season. On 12 July 2009, he was sent to [[Org94]] on loan for 1 year. He took 45 wickets for an average of 20.97, which included five wickets in the last two ODIs of the series against [[Loc91]]. Recognizing the danger of being run out at the wicket-keeper 's end, Kulasekara ran alongside him to ensure that he ( not Sangakkara ) would be run out. At the end of an ODI series against [[Loc91]] in the UAE, he tore a hamstring and missed the test series. Two years later, the [[Org87]] put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. On 30 December 2014, however, he was recalled to the ODI squad for the series against [[Loc144]] at home. During the match against [[Org95]] on 27 November 2015, he took four wickets for 12 runs. He appeared before the Mahara magistrate, and was released on රු500, 000 bail. He is currently playing for the [[Org96]] in the [[Org97]]. After a dismal 4 – 18 start, the [[Org87]] seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. He announced his retirement from competitive football in 1997 at the end of the NSL season. They changed their name again, settling on [[Misc105]]. In 1957, he started as a youth and assistant manager at [[Org98]]. In 1964, he took his first assignment as a head manager at DFC and became champion of the second division in his first year. After a day off, the [[Org87]] started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the [[Org87]] went 41 – 12. The word \" reliability \" can be traced back to 1816, and is first attested to the poet [[Per162]]. In the 1920 s, product improvement through the use of statistical process control was promoted by Dr. [[Per163]] A. [[Per164]] at [[Org99]], around the time that Waloddi Weibull was working on statistical models for fatigue. Bellcore issued the first consumer prediction methodology for telecommunications, and SAE developed a similar document SAE870050 for automotive applications. Many engineering techniques are used in reliability risk assessments, such as reliability block diagrams, hazard analysis, failure mode and effects analysis ( FMEA ), fault tree analysis ( FTA ), Reliability Centered Maintenance, ( probabilistic ) load and material stress and wear calculations, ( probabilistic ) fatigue and creep analysis, human error analysis, manufacturing defect analysis, reliability testing, etc. [[Org89]] tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the [[Org100]] went 16 – 16. On [[Misc8]], \" [[Misc106]] 's 11 \" holds a rating of 48 %, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 5.33 / 10. It was significantly revised and published in King 's collection \" Skeleton Crew \" in 1985. \" The Devil 's Gift \" was later re-edited as the second story in the film \" [[Misc107]] \", which was featured on the television series \" [[Misc108]] 3000 \". In the \" Supernatural \" episode \" Home \", the evil entity of the episode possesses a toy monkey with cymbals, which turned on the garbage disposal while a plumber was working with the sink. After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the [[Org87]] only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. After being appointed curator he moved to [[Loc145]]. He moved away from [[Loc145]] and died in 1947. Lincoln consists of two parts, that at the top of the cliff and that in [[Loc146]] valley. The site of the collection is on the steep slope between the two and within the Roman colonia which linked the first century legionary fortress with the shipping and commerce in the river. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the [[Org87]] ' deals. Much of the new building is faced and paved with Ancaster stone and borrows the concept of the glass-covered courtyard from the [[Loc147]] in a feature reminiscent of a medieval alley. The mosaic is the largest to be discovered in [[Loc145]] for over a hundred years. It includes a satellite photograph of the county of [[Loc148]] on a scale which permits fields and villages to be sought out while the picture 's extent allows a general pattern of geology and the influence of the Roman roads to show through. The gallery 's specialism is in the works of [[Per165]] Wint, a former [[Loc145]] resident. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the [[Org87]] ' runs in a 4 – 2 win over the [[Org100]]. On 2 April 2019 a public meeting was held at [[Loc149]] to discuss the issue, and on 13 April an art march was held. He is the current coach of the [[Loc73]] men ’s national team, having been appointed to the role in May 2018 following a ball tampering scandal under the previous head coach, [[Per166]]. Despite having been one of the leading runscorers in [[Loc73]] 's domestic limited-overs competition, he only played eight One Day International matches for [[Loc73]], all during a period from 1994 to 1997. He retained his place for the following tour of [[Loc144]]. However, that proved to be the only time the [[Org87]] were over. He captained the Prime Minister 's XI in December 2005 in their match against the [[Loc150]]. On 20 April 2007 he became the first [[Loc151]] player to score two triple centuries in the [[Misc109]] when he hit 315 against [[Loc152]] in a match noted for its batting. He commented in an interview with [[Org67]] [[Loc151]] that he was in discussions to potentially return at some point to the county in the future in a coaching capacity. A game which [[Loc151]] lost by two runs. Perhaps the [[Org87]] ' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Customizable Tachikoma sentient tanks, which can operate independently as AI characters or be ridden inside by players, accompany the player at all times. Aramaki is also available for multiplayer matches. In addition, Tachikoma robots can act as an AI companion, and players can select from four Tachikoma \" characters \", balanced, aggressive, intelligent and humorous. Controls are similar to other first person shooter games on the platform, such as \" [[Misc110]] \" and \" Medal of Honor : Heroes \". Immediately after the season, [[Per167]] was hired away from the [[Org101]] as general manager. It tells the story of [[Per168]], a [[Misc111]] informant in the early 1960 s who was the first ever mafioso to acknowledge the organization 's existence. The film departed from the true story of [[Per168]], as recounted in the [[Per169]] book, in a number of ways. The continued opposition of the clerical party, however, brought about his resignation on 22 December 1894, when he was succeeded by [[Per170]] [[Per171]]. On 1 January 1897 he was appointed president of the newly created judicial commission at [[Loc153]], and for the next few years held aloof from politics, even under the ex-lex government of [[Per172]]. In 1992, the [[Org87]] returned to the [[Misc112]] and once again defeated the [[Org102]] in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win. Built before [[Misc26]], its central square was designed by the architect [[Per173]]. At the time of his death, he was the world 's second longest-serving living head of state ( independent ), just below the King of [[Loc154]], [[Per174]]. He was succeeded by his only son, who became Prince [[Per175]]. Entering the full squad he was initially overshadowed by [[Per176]], and as a result appeared in only one league match during the 2001 – 02 season and one in the following, under head coach [[Per177]]. [[Org89]] needed a stunning 55 – 19 finish to edge out the [[Org100]], who led the [[Org87]] by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. After a promising first few [[Misc113]] 1 matches, however, his form rapidly declined, and he lost the starting job to 20-year - old understudy [[Per178]], shortly before the winter break. He started out well, but got injured towards the end of the first half of the season in [[Loc83]] and lost his place to youngster [[Per179]] ; after recovering he never managed to reclaim his place in the starting eleven, being demoted to as low as third-choice after a run-in with head coach [[Per180]]. Six days later he started at home against [[Org103]], and made the highlight reel with a string of spectacular saves on [[Per181]], [[Per182]] and [[Per183]], though the opponents still won 1 – 0 on a deflected first half goal. On 7 October, after suffering an injury against [[Org104]] Javor Ivanjica, he was sidelined for the rest of the year, but was still named in the league 's best eleven due to his performances. In December 2005, team owner [[Org105]], which inherited the [[Org87]] after purchasing [[Org106]] in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale. He made his debut on 1 February 2013, in the 0 – 2 away loss against RC [[Org107]]. He continued to be a regular for [[Loc155]]. He conceded one goal, a penalty kick scored by [[Per184]]. He made his second appearance for [[Loc155]] in the 2010 [[Misc15]], keeping a clean sheet and impressing in the goalless draw against [[Loc14]]. Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team. His performance in the round of 16 against [[Loc72]], with a total of 11 saves, helped push the game into overtime. He was [[Loc155]] 's starting goalkeeper as he started every game of [[Loc155]] 's tournament winning run and played every minute of the competition for [[Loc155]]. This song was covered by [[Per185]] on his 1999 album, \" She Rides Wild Horses \". Three ABC episodes are held by the [[Org108]]. On May 16, 2007, [[Org92]] 's owners approved the sale. He played great after his return, especially in the first six months, when his goals directly decided the winner in a few games, thus being one of the most deserving for [[Org109]] 's title in the 2007 – 08 season, the club 's first after three years. He was also a member of the team at the 2006 [[Misc15]]. His legacy and contribution is widespread among the works of contemporary Greek music, through the second half of the 20th and into the 21st century. He was also one of the main proponents of the \" Éntekhno \" form of music ( along with Mikis Theodorakis ). They also released veteran pitcher [[Per154]]. In 2004, it was re-released, digitally remastered as an audiophile LP and a CD in the [[Org110]] collection. He was buried in Paiania. In mathematics, the \" [[Per186]] normalization lemma \" is a result of commutative algebra, introduced by [[Per187]] in 1926. The integer \" d \" above is uniquely determined ; it is the Krull dimension of the ring \" A \". On July 10, 2009, the [[Org87]] traded outfielder [[Per188]] to the [[Org111]] for outfielder [[Per189]]. The theorem is also an important tool in establishing the notions of Krull dimension for \" k \" - algebras. Thus, it remains to show the Krull dimension of the polynomial ring \" S \" is \" d \". At the end of the season, he toured [[Loc144]] with an Australian second team and took 18 wickets at 16.44 average. During the inaugural [[Misc114]] he captured eight wickets in five matches, including 5 / 34 against [[Loc91]] at [[Loc156]], which was the first five wicket haul in ODIs. The 2010 [[Org87]] ' season featured an attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005. However, the extra exertion created \" hot spots \" in his back and not wanting to reaggravate his previous condition, he made himself unavailable for the 1977 tour of [[Loc14]]. He contributed 25 wickets to [[Loc73]] 's first victory in the competition. A return of 39 Test wickets ( at 22.30 ) for series was the best of his career Despite possessing this potent attack, [[Loc73]] lost the series by 1&ndash ; 3 when [[Per190]] turned in a series of brilliant individual performances. Nevertheless, his 11 wickets in six ODIs helped [[Loc73]] win the tournament with a victory over [[Loc144]] in the final. [[Org89]] were once again skippered by [[Per191]], in his 25th and final season managing the team. Along with [[Per192]] he announced his retirement during the final Test at [[Loc110]], and took eight wickets, including a wicket with his last delivery in the match. He was not disciplined by the ACB for this incident. These odds were flashed on the scoreboard during a break in the game and noticed by the Australian players. Between them, they collected 7,500 pounds when [[Loc14]] pulled off a comeback victory. [[Org89]] started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. On March 11, 2015, he was acquired by the [[Loc157]] Warriors. The name stems from bulls which supported the coat of arms of Sir [[Per193]]. It was Lutyens-designed house, [[Loc158]]. He joined [[Loc159]] in 1998. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the [[Org87]] longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row. He has been the regular player since he joined [[Loc160]] on the right side for the team. In 2012, he was chosen as the club 's captain after Farhad Majidi left the club on loan to [[Org112]]. After spending 8 seasons at [[Loc160]], by end of 2011 – 12 season he moved to [[Org113]] along with Esmaeil Sharifat. He left [[Org113]] in summer 2013 and joined [[Org114]] side Paykan. On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman [[Per194]] from the [[Org115]]. In March 1917 he joined Polish Military Organisation. After the [[Loc161]] invasion of [[Loc41]] in 1939, he fled to neutral [[Loc120]]. After graduation in 1900, he decided to study medicine at the [[Org116]] of [[Loc162]]. At the same time, he was actively involved in the activities of the [[Loc163]] of Active Struggle. On October 13, 2010, the [[Org87]] announced that [[Per195]] would replace long-time [[Org87]] manager [[Per191]] as manager of the team in 2011. Released after the February Revolution ( March 17, 1917 ), he continued working for the [[Org117]]. Together with other activists, he prepared the assassination of General [[Per196]] Beseler, but the attack was cancelled. He lived in the Belweder, together with the Marshal. Furthermore, he dissolved the structures of government health insurance program, which were in the hands of oppositional [[Org117]]. The announcement came just two days after the 2010 [[Org87]] were eliminated from the postseason. On his wife 's side, his mother-in-law is from [[Loc164]] and his father-in-law is from Karnal. He remains one of only a few to reach 10,000 1st class runs in [[Loc91]]. He got a national call against [[Loc14]]. He was regarded as one of the prominent batsman playing in [[Loc91]] 's domestic circuit. [[Per197]] was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010. He was awarded the man of the match for his match winning performance which earned [[Loc91]] a place in the semi-finals of the tournament. [[Loc14]] had scored 263 runs for 6 wickets during their 44 over innings. However, he was recalled back to the [[Loc91]] squad and played in the 1996 Cricket [[Misc114]]. He has also worked as the chief executive of the [[Org118]], but resigned from his job in August 2004, citing increasing media commitments. According to [[Per198]] Sports [[Org119]], the [[Org87]] had an all-time franchise win-loss record over. The special was first released on home video in October, and then aired on The WB network on December 21st, 2000. She even admits that she hates the true meaning of Christmas and is nothing more than a greedy person. In the Symphyla they are associated with spinnerets. The [[Misc115]], or earwigs, are well known for the forcipate cerci that most of them bear, though species in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina do not. [[Org89]] become only the second team in big league history with 10,000 losses after the [[Org120]] reached the plateau in 2007. During [[Misc26]] his family moved back to [[Loc165]] and then in 1943 to [[Loc79]]. His teachers also included [[Per199]]. [[Per199]] wrote both his first and second cello concertos for Rostropovich, who also gave their first performances. for solo cello ) as well as [[Per200]] ( \" [[Misc116]] à quatre \" for piano, cello, oboe, flute and orchestra ). With late season injuries to starters Jair Jurrjens and [[Per201]], these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence. In 1993, he was instrumental in the foundation of the Kronberg Academy and was a patron until his death. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans have lived in the Verde Valley for at least 10,000 years. The earliest signs of permanent settlement in the area appear quite a bit later, however, around 600 CE. The earliest of the ruins located on the property ( with the exception of the irrigation canal ), a \" pithouse \" in the traditional Hohokam style, dates to about 1050 CE. [[Org89]] entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above. It is located on the Durme, a tributary of the [[Loc166]], and is the second most important city of the Waasland after Sint-Niklaas. Mayor [[Per202]] ( Open-VLD ) was elected for a fourth mandate during the elections on 14 October 2018. A Roman road ran along the Durme river. Unlike the older settlements, the new village came to be built on the right bank of the Durme. With 27 games to play, the [[Org87]] went 9 – 18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89 – 73. Eight years later, he again ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of [[Loc63]], this time finishing second with 22 per cent of the vote. He first came to [[Loc63]] in his teens when his father worked there. He also played in the [[Org121]] where he had solid credentials. Thereafter, he filed an annulment of marriage case which was later dismissed by a [[Loc167]] regional trial court, [[Per203]] 255. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, [[Org87]] setup man [[Per204]] posted a 5.11 September ERA. During eight seasons in [[Org122]], he played 130 matches and scored five goals. Others participating in the game included [[Per205]] Speaker, [[Per206]], [[Per207]] and [[Per208]]. His performance attracted the attention of other clubs and he was soon linked to clubs like [[Org123]], [[Loc168]] and [[Org124]]. On 5 July 2009, the transfer was officially announced on the website of [[Org123]], after he passed a medical test. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by [[Org87]] manager [[Per195]]. He would later join Uşakspor and [[Org125]]. During his tenure with [[Org125]], he was promoted to the national team. He reached his peak of career with joining [[Org126]] in 1975 / 76 season where he will have spent his nine years. Following this achievement, he was hired by [[Org126]] as team coach. Veteran starter [[Per209]] posted a win-loss record of 0 – 5 in September with an ERA of 8.75. Pricing for the 2008 model started at $ 111,300 ; making it at the time one of [[Org127]] ' most expensive vehicles. Afterward he served as governor of [[Loc169]] and [[Loc170]], and was the first royal governor of the colonial [[Loc171]] of [[Loc172]] following a rebellion against its proprietors. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and died a bachelor in [[Loc111]], [[Loc14]], in 1728. The following day, a council of militia officers called on [[Per210]] to take command of the city militia. [[Org89]] starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games. Despite his best efforts to retain his post, he was recalled and replaced in 1705 by [[Per211]]. He also acted as a consultant to the Board of Trade, and thus maintained an awareness of colonial issues. The publicity of this scheme increased dislike of him in Virginia, and may have played a role in his recall. [[Loc173]] was not militarily affected by the war. In 2012, the [[Org87]] began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. He established local governments modeled on those he set up in [[Loc174]] and Virginia, including the 1722 incorporation of [[Loc18]]. He expended both public money and his own to further both education and the Church of [[Loc14]], and introduced ground-breaking judicial administration into the colony. and promoted trade, pursuing policies similar to those he had advocated while in [[Loc174]] and Virginia. It did, however, anger merchant interests enough to raise complaints against him with the Board of Trade. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder [[Per212]], along with shortstops [[Per213]] and [[Per214]]. He never married, and died in [[Loc111]] on 5 / 16 March 1728 / 9. He was buried in the parish of [[Loc175]] [[Loc176]]. The game was ported to the [[Misc117]], [[Misc118]] and personal computers. As such, they directed [[Per215]] to create a light gun shooter, which was one of the most popular game genres in arcades at the time. Fans at [[Loc130]] began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. It features a more sophisticated storyline and the voices of [[Per216]], [[Org128]], and [[Per217]]. Tiger Electronics later released a handheld version of the game with an LCD screen and small light gun. He would later ( in 1990 ) try out for the [[Org129]] and [[Org130]], but otherwise, his entire 14 year, 250 game, career was played in [[Loc59]]. He then stayed in [[Loc177]]. [[Org89]] lost the game 6 – 3, ending their season. The bill was signed into law by President [[Per218]] on March 3, 1875. That design, by the late chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht, following a concept by Thomas [[Loc178]] and [[Per219]], was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck. He is the younger brother of [[Per220]], who is also a professional racing driver. According to stand-up comedian and future \" [[Misc108]] 3000 \" star [[Per221]], he was asked to be one of the stars of the proposed series. From July 26 to August 10, the [[Org87]] won 14 games in a row. Very popular with this bird are Zingiberales, such as \" Costus scaber \" ( Costaceae ), or \" Heliconia standleyi \" and \" Heliconia stricta \" ( Heliconiaceae ). Other well-liked foodplants of this hummingbird include [[Misc119]] like \" Duroia hirsuta \", \" Palicourea lasiantha \", \" Psychotria bahiensis \" and \" Psychotria platypoda \" ( [[Loc179]] ), Lamiales such as \" Sanchezia peruviana \" ( [[Loc180]] ) or \" Drymonia semicordata \" ( Gesneriaceae ), and Myrtales like \" Cuphea melvilla \" ( Lythraceae ). \" Sphere \" is a 1987 novel by [[Per222]], his sixth novel under his own name and his sixteenth overall. It was adapted into the film \" Sphere \" in 1998. He was honored before 51,300 fans at [[Loc130]] in [[Loc181]]. Reviews for the film were mixed ; it earned a 38 % rating on [[Misc8]] based on reviews from 117 critics, with the site 's consensus being that the film itself was not the equal of [[Per223]] 's strong performance. On [[Misc120]], the film has averaged a 53 rating from 28 critics. Over the course of 16 seasons, he amassed [[Misc121]] totals of 353 games and 44 goals. In the following five years, he represented [[Org131]]. He served as a staple of the [[Org87]] franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. He shared that role with [[Org132]] 's shot-stopper [[Per224]]. He then went on to start [[Org133]] 's remaining games as they defied all odds and avoided relegation on the last day of the season with a 1 – 0 win over [[Org134]] at [[Loc182]]. Its title is taken from a poem by [[Per225]] and a translated version of the poem was printed on the record 's inner sleeve. He enjoyed his only Number 1 hit single in May 1988, a cover of the [[Org3]] ' \" She 's Leaving Home \", a shared A-side with [[Org135]] 's \" With a [[Misc122]] from My Friends \". [[Per226]] played his last regular season game for the [[Org87]] on September 30, 2012. Stylistically, it continued to explore genres of Americana and Alternative country, a natural progression since \" [[Misc123]] \". In April 2017, they played in [[Loc73]]. The speech was made available on the [[Org136]] of [[Loc14]] 's website. The tour would cover the [[Loc108]] and the [[Loc112]] and [[Loc183]] throughout 2019. This was also [[Org87]] manager [[Per195]] 's first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990 ; including his first since becoming the manager of the [[Org87]] after the 2010 season. He instantly commanded a first team place at the Brazilian team. In his second season, he fell out with coach [[Per227]] and was not featured in [[Loc184]] 's starting 11 for the majority of the season and only played 5 league matches. He scored his first goal for [[Org70]] against [[Org137]] scoring a free kick. Throughout his career, he has also played for the [[Org138]], [[Org52]], [[Org139]], [[Org140]], [[Org141]] and [[Org142]]. The move is to follow the expiration of the [[Org87]] ' 20-year lease on [[Loc130]] in 2016. He was the second alternate choice, after [[Per228]], who replaced an injured [[Per229]]. Over that stretch, he averaged 13.0 points and 4.1 assists in 27.6 minutes per game, as he shared the point guard role with [[Per230]]. Two days later, he was claimed off waivers then immediately waived by the [[Loc185]] 76ers. Despite reaching a settlement with the team, he was ineligible to return for the 2010 playoffs, as he was not an active roster player before the NHL trade deadline. During the offseason the [[Org87]] signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts ; [[Per231]] ( 4 years / $ 42 \" million ), [[Per232]] ( 8 years / $ 135 M ), [[Per233]] ( 1 year / $ 5.8 M ), [[Per234]] ( 2 years / $ 13.3 M ), [[Per235]] ( 6 years / $ 32.4 M ) and [[Per214]] ( 7 years / $ 58 M ). There has been a choir at the cathedral since 1526, when [[Per236]] was the organist and also master of the choristers. The nave, choir, main tower and transepts are late [[Per237]]. There are architectural features ranging from [[Per237]] to the Perpendicular style and a large rose window of the ten-part ( i.e. botanical ) type. Former choristers include the composer [[Per238]]. [[Org89]] finished the season in a distant second place with a 79 – 83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990. He stayed in this position for two years before deciding to become a player-manager at VFC Plauen, where he remained for just a short time. He had been appointed on 16 January 2006 as a manager of [[Org143]] to replace [[Per239]] who left for 1. He had been appointed on 29 October 2007 as a manager of [[Org144]] to replace [[Per240]]. He extended his contract with [[Loc160]] until 2013 where he won the league title in the 2012 – 13 season. A day before the season began, the [[Org87]] made a final trade involving former All-Star [[Per231]] and outfielder [[Per241]] [[Per242]]. The name of the show was based on the [[Per243]] song \" Scars \". In 1997, their first full-length album, entitled Old Friends from Young Years, was released. It was released in September 1971 as the second single and title track from the album \" [[Misc124]] of Many [[Misc125]] \". She composed the song in 1969, while traveling with [[Per244]] on a tour bus. They were traded to the [[Org145]] for outfielders [[Per245]] and [[Per246]] [[Per247]] along with two minor league players. In June 2011, the [[Org146]] announced that, from 1 October 2011, runners could no longer be used in international cricket. They soon signed to [[Org147]] to release a full-length CD. In June 2006, drummer [[Per248]] left the band to focus on his other band RUST. The bank collapsed in 1995 after suffering losses of £ 827 million ( £ billion in ) resulting from fraudulent investments, primarily in futures contracts, conducted by its employee [[Per249]], working at its office in [[Loc186]]. By the beginning of the season, the [[Org87]] did 11 trades in all. The assets of the old house and several partners were taken over and liquidated to repay the rescue consortium, with guarantees provided by the [[Org136]] of [[Loc14]]. Lord Revelstoke and others lost their partnerships along with their personal fortunes, which were pledged to support the bank. Revelstoke did not live to see this accomplished, dying in 1897. He reported to British tax authorities a £ 102 million profit. [[Org89]] began the season on a nine-game losing streak, which is the worst opening by the franchise since 1988, when they dropped the first 10 games of that season. After his excellent performances for [[Loc187]] he finally accepted the offer from [[Org148]] and was one of the key players in 2008 – 09 for [[Org148]] to win the league. He left [[Org148]] in 2010, joining [[Org149]] with a 2-year contract. He extended his contract with [[Loc160]] on 13 July 2013, keeping him at the club until 2016. He played his last game for [[Loc160]] in a 2 – 1 win against [[Org150]] on 16 May 2019. After a 9 – 28 start in 2016, [[Per195]] was fired on May 17 and replaced by third base coach [[Per250]] as interim general manager. The two of them became minority owners of the [[Org151]] baseball team in September 2018. Before turning professional, she won the juniors singles title at [[Loc188]] in 1972. It appeared six days a week in the newspaper \" De Standaard \" and a few other ones. He mostly wanders around in medieval [[Loc32]] as a lonely noble knight. During the 2016 offseason, the [[Org87]] signed pitchers [[Per251]] and [[Per252]] and promoted interim manager [[Per250]] to full-time manager. The residents of Bunkerville, so named by [[Per253]], shared the work and the fruits of their work, with all land being held in common. In the traditional way, logs were pulled by horses or oxen to [[Loc189]] and floated down to the mill but due to a rainless summer the [[Loc189]] dried up and logs could not be moved to the mill. Their shingle mill at [[Loc189]] started operating in 1912. That all ended with the expulsion and Japanese-Canadian internment in 1942. During this time the [[Org87]] became one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball, earning 14 straight division titles through 2005, including five world series berths, and one world series championship during the 1995 season. On June 15, 2008, the [[Org152]] signed him to a minor league contract. The \" Chaukhandi \" ( ; ) \" tombs \" form an early Islamic cemetery situated east of [[Loc190]], in the [[Loc191]] province of [[Loc91]]. The tombs are similar in style to the elaborate tombs at the [[Loc192]] near Thatta, and are built in the funerary architectural style typical of lower [[Loc191]]. They were mainly built during Mughal rule sometime in the 15th and 18th centuries when [[Misc126]] became dominant. [[Org89]] currently have five different game baseball uniform combinations. He considered the tombs to be of approximately the same date as the tombs of [[Per254]] Shah Kalhoro - i.e. the second half of the 18th century. These tribes had close relations among each other, including matrimonial ties, both within their own group as well as with the [[Misc127]] tribe of the Kalmatis. With a few exceptions human figures are avoided, in accordance with Islamic beliefs. The short was followed by two sequels, \" A Close Shave \", released in December 1995, and \" A [[Misc128]] Loaf and Death \" released in December 2008. [[Org89]] have worn two versions of their alternate navy blue road jerseys. Also altered ( again for reasons of copyright ) are two specific songs from the penguin 's radio which were replaced with extracts from Hammond organ versions of \" [[Misc129]] a Yellow Ribbon Round the [[Per255]] Oak [[Loc193]] \". It has a unanimously positive score on [[Misc8]], with 24 reviews, 100 % positive and an average score of 9.1 / 10. The feature starred [[Per256]], [[Per257]], and [[Per258]]. The film received generally poor reviews, but received wide viewership for [[Per259]] 's role. For 2019, the [[Org87]] drastically changed the uniform to feature red lettering, a red tomahawk and silver piping. He then lost the record to [[Per260]] before regaining it when he caught Mushfiqur Rahim of [[Loc135]] in February 2008. Later in 2006, on 20 September, he made his maiden ODI century, hitting an unbeaten 147 against [[Loc194]] from a mere 68 balls. However, this was later broken by [[Per261]] with 36 runs off one over, the most possible without no-balls or wides. He was not wearing a protective helmet or glasses when he was struck by the bail after leg-spinner [[Per262]] bowled [[Loc151]] 's Gemaal [[Per263]]. However, they are also subject to [[Org92]] rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. The mesothorax is the segment that bears the forewings in all winged insects, though sometimes these may be reduced or modified, as in beetles ( [[Loc195]] ) or [[Misc115]], in which they are sclerotized to form the elytra ( \" wing covers \" ), and the Strepsiptera, in which they are reduced to form halteres. In some groups of insects, the mesonotum is hypertrophied, such as in [[Misc130]], [[Misc131]], and [[Misc132]] ), in which the anterior portion of the mesonotum ( called the mesoscutum, or simply \" scutum \" ) forms most of the dorsal surface of the thorax. In [[Misc130]] and [[Misc131]] the mesothoracic scutellum is also distinct, but much smaller than the mesoscutum. \" L. chiricahuensis \" may remain a valid taxon for the southern and eastern range of the Chiricahua leopard frog. In 1985, the [[Org87]] made a small script change to the logo. He retired from the game in the following year, but returned three years later for a brief spell in [[Loc196]] with Semarang [[Org153]]. Ten years later, he appeared with the national team in the [[Misc133]] in [[Loc197]], in an eventual group stage exit. The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence. In [[Loc72]], both the federal government and the states enacted legislation. \" In July 2020, the team faced mounting pressure to change after the [[Org13]] and [[Org154]] announced they were discussing brand change. The PIPEDA brings [[Loc59]] into compliance with EU data protection law. Very few states, however, recognize an individual 's right to privacy, a notable exception being [[Loc198]]. 375 - gives [[Loc198]] residents an array of new rights, starting with the right to be informed about what kinds of personal data companies have collected and why it was collected. In addition, the CIPSEA statute protects confidentiality of data collected by federal statistical agencies. [[Org89]] have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently [[Per226]] ' number 10 in 2013, [[Per153]] 's number 29 in 2012, [[Per191]] 's number 6 in 2011, [[Per154]] 's number 47 in 2010, and [[Per152]] 's number 31 in 2009. She was mentored by [[Per264]]. She won the ITF singles tournament in Ismailia ( 1996 ), [[Loc199]] ( 1997 ) ; Šibenik ( 1998 ) and in [[Loc200]] ( 1999 ). She won the mixed-doubles tournament with [[Per265]]. She won her fourth career doubles title at [[Loc201]] ( with [[Per266]] ). After years of stability, the [[Org87]] have faced a period of transition in their radio and television coverage. Her best season to date was highlighted by two singles and four doubles titles as well as a career-best victory over [[Per267]]. Her best finish in a major was a third-round loss at [[Loc188]] to [[Per268]]. In [[Loc202]], she reached the semifinals in doubles with [[Loc203]] Safina. On both occasions, she lost to [[Per269]] in the next round. [[Org155]] showed 70 games throughout the country, then cleared the decks to make way for a new national broadcast package that began in earnest with the 2007 postseason, and expanded to Sunday afternoon games in 2008. Later in the season, he took his maiden 10 wicket haul against [[Loc204]], and finished the season with a respectable 71 wickets at 27.01. He shone on the tour, finishing with a first-class bowling average of 28.60, by far the best on the [[Loc14]] team. When he did play, he showed his class, taking 6 / 70 against [[Loc205]], and 6 / 51 against [[Loc206]] in the space of a few weeks. In his final match of the 1995 season, he hit his highest total with the bat, 92 against [[Loc207]]. After the 2004 season, longtime radio flagship station 750 WSB was replaced by WGST 640AM. He finished off his season with 10 wickets against [[Loc208]], once again claiming a five-fer in each innings. and provided the avant-garde jazz background to the Surrealistic poems recited live by [[Per270]]. The major factor, he notes, was his familiarization with transistor computers at the Economic Calculations laboratory and the [[Loc209]] Academy of Economic Studies, during an era of \" sheer luck \" - that is, when liberalization allowed [[Loc210]] to trade in electronics with the [[Loc108]]. That season the team traded away their aging star passer [[Per271]] to the [[Org156]] for the much younger [[Per272]]. As of the 2009 season, the [[Org87]] returned to WKLS on the FM frequency but remained on WGST on AM. The fish is native to the [[Loc211]] and [[Loc212]]. In the [[Loc211]] it is replaced by the yellow teardrop butterflyfish ( \" Chaetodon interruptus \" ), now a separate species but previously considered a subspecies of \" Chaetodon unimaculatus \". In 1998, [[Org157]] released the concert on compact disc, in both a two-CD version and a complete eight-CD version. All tracks with [[Per273]] are indicated. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a tall halite mineral formation called [[Loc213]] [[Loc214]]. After an operation, though, he surprisingly returned to cricket and was selected in the Under–19 state team for the national championships in [[Loc215]]. He returned as vice-captain the following year for the Under–19 carnival in [[Loc216]], and scored a century in the opening match. This remains the greatest proportion since [[Per274]] made 165 not out in the very first test innings of all, which was 67.34 per cent of his team 's total. Also in 2009, he hosted \" [[Loc73]] 's Greatest [[Org158]] \" ( alongside [[Per275]] ), which aired on Saturday afternoons in January and February. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the [[Loc217]] and [[Loc213]] [[Loc214]] ( on the southwest side of the lake ). Be prepare to mail away for the [ \" Invisiclues \" ] \". It is filmed in the network 's studios in [[Loc218]], [[Loc219]]. The original [[Per276]] and [[Per277]] lyrics were \" You need to give it up / Had about enough / It 's not hard to see / The boy is mine \". The video was directed by [[Per278]]. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. There are also approximately 27 enclaves in southern [[Loc49]] and [[Loc220]] and in western [[Loc221]], where they are known as the \" Madrean sky islands \". He was a [[Misc15]] champion in 1970 as a reserve player, at age 20. [[Per279]] repeated the feat in 2006 in a group stage match against [[Loc107]]. He then moved to Vissel [[Loc222]] of [[Loc107]], where he stayed for only four matches. According to researchers of the [[Per280]] Gurion [[Org116]] of the [[Loc223]], treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy. Like his predecessor [[Per281]], he struggled having top players available for qualifying matches. He tried to centre the squad around [[Per282]] and younger players with little international experience. [[Per283]] was chosen the second one. She later described her rapid promotion as having caused dissatisfaction amongst some older [[Org159]] TDs who resented the rise of a 28-year - old woman. [[Misc134]] \" in turn nourished carotenoid-containing ( red-pigmented ) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. The role was originated by [[Per284]] in 1971, who portrayed the Master until his death in 1973. From 1976 until the show 's cancellation in 1989, the Master was portrayed by a succession of actors : [[Per285]], [[Per286]] and [[Per287]]. [[Per288]] took on the role for the 1996 \" Doctor Who \" TV film. Since the show 's revival in 2005, the Master has been portrayed by [[Per289]], [[Per290]], [[Per291]], and [[Per292]]. The delta of the [[Loc224]] was formerly a jungle of papyrus and palm trees. He first appeared in \" [[Misc135]] of the [[Misc136]] \" ( 1971 ). The Master 's title was deliberately chosen by producer [[Per293]] and script editor Terrance Dicks because, like the Doctor, it was a title conferred by an academic degree. [[Per293]] had one man in mind for the role : [[Per284]], who had a long history of screen villainy and had already made three attempts to break into the series. He had worked previously with [[Per293]] and was a good friend of [[Per294]]. In Roman and [[Misc137]] times, sugarcane, henna, and sycamore fig all made the lower [[Loc225]] valley wealthy. The Master subsequently escapes in a hovercraft. Played by [[Per285]] in his next appearance, with heavy make-up that makes him resemble an emaciated corpse, the Master returns in \" The Deadly Assassin \" ( 1976 ). From there, through Nyssa ( [[Per295]] ), the Master orchestrates the series of events that leads to the Doctor 's regeneration into his fifth incarnation ( [[Per296]] ). However, as posited in the novelisation of the television movie by [[Per297]], the Master 's self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a \" morphant \". One of the most valuable products produced by [[Loc226]] was the sap of the balsam tree, which could be made into perfume. However, the Master finds his human host to be unsustainable as the body slowly begins to degenerate, although the Master has the added abilities to spit an acid-like bile, both as a weapon and to mentally control victims as an alternative to his usual hypnotic abilities. As well as this, as foreshadowed in \" Gridlock \", the [[Misc138]] of Boe ( voice of Struan Rodger ) gives the Doctor a message before dying : \" You are not alone \". When the Doctor appears aboard the ship with the Master 's own future incarnation, he meets his successor, [[Per298]] ( [[Per291]] ), who is struggling between her nature and a promise to reform her ways. In the second part, the two [[Misc139]] pair off as friends, but [[Per298]] 's loyalties remain divided between the Doctor and her old self. By the 19th century, [[Loc226]] 's fertility had disappeared. [[Per298]] 's gradual reform is indicated in several more episodes. [[Misc140]] aboard the ship together, [[Per298]] finds her loyalties torn between her promise to the Doctor and the lure of her old self. Enraged at the idea of ever becoming the Doctor 's ally, the Master shoots [[Per298]] with his laser screwdriver, ostensibly disabling her ability to regenerate and killing her. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in \" [[Misc141]] \", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. King [[Per93]] was said to have hidden from [[Per299]] at Ein [[Loc227]] nearby. During the course of \" The Sound of Drums \", the Master unveils a new handheld weapon : a laser screwdriver. The screwdriver itself also contains isomorphic technology, a biometric security feature which effectively disables use of the device by anyone other than the Master. He is subsequently captured and forced to work for the fascist rulers of this Earth, who keep him alive, in agony, using life support systems. In \" Deadly Reunion \", he attempts to control powerful forces through a cult, but finds himself at the mercy of a godlike alien. The best known of these are the [[Per300]] of [[Loc228]], who left an extensive library known as the [[Misc142]]. In both stories, the two [[Misc139]] are characterised very differently from their previous appearances. The first series ends with the Master using a chameleon arch to turn himself into an infant human, setting up the events of \" [[Misc141]] \". [[Per301]] made a guest appearance as the alternate-universe Master in series four. The \" Doctor Who \" role-playing game published by [[Org160]] in 1985 has two modules outlining the Master 's personal history, a timeline of his activities and an inventory of much of the equipment he has obtained during his travels. They became known and famous as the [[Misc142]]. The cave is located east of the village of Durness and is presently served by a car park, toilets, stairs and walkways. It was designed by [[Per302]] and features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The protagonist of the game is a muscular, loincloth-wearing, Tarzanesque tribesman named [[Misc143]] ( known in [[Loc107]] and in some ports as JuJu ), who up until recently lived a primitive yet contented life in the jungles of a vast and wild island in the [[Misc144]]. [[Org161]] published ports for the [[Misc145]] Lynx and the [[Misc146]]. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by [[Org162]]. At the beginning of \" [[Misc147]] \", [[Loc62]] is a continent divided. On the international scale, the [[Loc229]] has reformed itself around conservative Prime Minister [[Per303]] and fascistic \" silver shirts \" led by [[Per304]]. [[Loc230]] and [[Loc231]] fall first, followed by an advance into [[Loc232]]. Meanwhile, a black revolt takes place in [[Loc233]]. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the [[Loc234]] Works, a company that converts the sea 's raw materials. The [[Loc229]] nukes [[Loc235]]. That year, the team won the Double. He also played left wing for the [[Org163]], [[Org164]], [[Org165]] and [[Org166]]. On July 1, 2006, he signed a 2-year, $ 3 million contract with the [[Org167]]. Most of the track is managed by Network Rail, which in 2017 had a network of of standard-gauge lines, of which were electrified. The regiment has produced one Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Nirmal Chander Vij. [[Misc148]] raiders had besieged and reduced Skardu in early 1948. It was vital that Leh, the next likely target, be relieved before it was attacked by the raiders. After independence the regimental centre was constructed in [[Loc236]], [[Loc237]]. In addition, some cities have separate metro, light rail and tram systems ( including the extensive and historic [[Loc238]] ). Additionally, NeuVax ( [[Loc239]] Biopharma ) is a peptide-based immunotherapy that directs \" killer \" T cells to target and destroy cancer cells that express HER2. The timber business accounts for most of the economy in Tortel to this day. The village is served by a nearby [[Loc240]] [[Per305]] Airport ; the airstrip is 600 m long and 23 m wide. Five days later, [[Org168]] released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode ( which never aired ) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network ( first proposed by 19th century Prime Minister [[Per306]] as early as the 1830 s ). In 1941, construction began on the second bridge between [[Loc241]] and Indialantic. It was adapted by [[Per307]], produced and directed by [[Per308]] with [[Loc242]] [[Loc243]] and [[Per309]] as co-producers. The film stars [[Per310]], [[Per83]], [[Per311]], and [[Per312]]. In March 2011, researchers at [[Org169]] announced in \" Neurology \" that ibuprofen had a neuroprotective effect against the risk of developing Parkinson 's disease. The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960 s, with [[Org170]] manager Dr. [[Per313]] commissioned by the government under [[Per314]] with reorganising the railways. Parts of the film were shot in Snow Canyon State Park. With the budget of a television movie, which was around twice the budget used for the first part, many action and comedic scenes are rehashes of scenes from the previous two \" Smokey and the [[Misc149]] \" films. On [[Misc8]] it has an approval rating of 17 % based on reviews from six critics. Both versions feature leading actress [[Per310]]. From a base of 90 % of trains arriving on time in 1998, the measure dipped to 75 % in mid-2001 due to stringent safety restrictions put in place after the [[Loc244]] crash in October 2000. This fault is about long, situated mainly along the western base of the hills on the east side of [[Loc245]]. It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the [[Loc246]]. [[Org171]] of [[Loc247]] Governments has prepared ground shaking maps that include a possible concurrent scenario ( these are shown below ). It occurred on the southern segment of the fault, receiving its name ( some decades later ) from the nascent town of Hayward where it was determined the quake 's epicenter was located. Conventional high-speed rail technology would be used as opposed to Maglev. Numerous chemical, radiological, and biohazardous materials are present ( in relatively small quantities ) on campus and on the associated [[Org172]] [[Org173]], in the hills above the university. As that portion includes the so-called [[Loc248]], the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The [[Org174]] Earth website, in cooperation with the [[Org175]], has prepared a virtual helicopter tour of the fault, with much additional information available through the tour. Like the other heralds at the Authority, the name is derived from the Canadian river of the same name. Light rail systems in the form of trams are in [[Loc98]], [[Loc249]], [[Loc250]], [[Loc251]], [[Loc252]] and [[Loc253]]. The pair also worked together in other projects, appearing together in the final seasons of \" [[Misc150]] \" as a gay couple. He signed a two-year deal worth 7.2 million Swedish kronor, with an option for a third year. He also netted 27 assists for a total of 62 points, second in the league only to his line mate [[Per315]]. That same day, he also signed a contract extension with Linköping, ensuring his return and keeping him in Linköping 's possession through 2012. [[Org176]] has the one remaining traditional tram system. In 60 games that season, 50 as a pinch hitter, McKnight collected 19 hits, including one triple, with six runs scored and five runs batted in. The longest continuous stretch available for hiking in is, from [[Loc254]] to the Eleven [[Loc255]]. [[Per316]] narrated the film. The landlord 's daughter ( [[Per317]] ), who listens from behind a door, is deeply impressed by the scene created by her old schoolmate. Transport commentator Christian Wolmar has asserted the high cost of leasing is due to the way the franchises are distributed to the train operating companies. It premiered on 7 September 1967 in [[Loc256]]. Released in [[Loc257]] it was also released in [[Loc258]]. \" Bauhinia acuminata \" is a species of flowering shrub native to tropical southeastern [[Loc259]]. It may be found as an escape from cultivation in some areas, and has become naturalised on the [[Loc260]], [[Loc73]]. See List of companies operating trains in the [[Loc229]]. In 1981, the show was picked up by [[Org177]], which stayed until 1988. In 1989, the show was picked up by TNN, which stayed until 2002. He was drafted by the [[Org151]] following his senior year in high school, but did not sign. There are also PROPs of matrices where the product is the [[Per318]] product, but in that class of PROPs the matrices must all be of the form ( sides are all powers of some common base ) ; these are the coordinate counterparts of appropriate symmetric monoidal categories of vector spaces under tensor product. From 1995 until 2009, 27 new lines ( totalling 199 track miles ) and 68 stations were opened, with 65 further new station sites identified by Network Rail or government for possible construction. In 2003, he married \" Will & Grace \" actress [[Per319]]. At the same time, he began appearing on television as a plumber on \" Will & Grace \" during its fourth season 's [[Misc151]] episode, on \" The King of Queens \", in three episodes of \" 24 \", and in an episode of \" The [[Loc261]] \". The couple have also appeared together in films such as \" The Kings of Summer \" and \" Smashed \", as well as performing voice work together in \" [[Loc262]] [[Loc263]] 2 \" and \" [[Per320]] 's Burgers \". production of \" Company \". These would be short-lead-time local projects, to be completed in timescales ranging from 2 years 9 months to 6 years, once approved by local and regional governments, Network Rail and the Department for Transport, complementing existing long-term national projects. Its trailer became a viral hit, scoring over one million hits on [[Org178]]. The film premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The pairing was suggested by [[Per321]], who wanted to play-off their supposed rivalry. On the fourth task, she won $ 50,000 for her charity, Children International. The 520ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research 's GEM released in February 1985. He is the half brother of [[Per322]]. In the first innings he opened the bowling with Tino Best ; he had to wait until the second to take his only wicket in the match, that of [[Per323]]. Having not impressed the coach during his final season he moved to [[Org43]] in 1985. Once the organism has gained access to the surface of the eye, it is able to invade through the epithelium and [[Org179]] 's layer. which refers to the [[Org180]] 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. In 1633 he was invited to [[Loc264]] to compose the music for wedding festivities there, eventually returning to [[Loc265]] in 1635. The Thirty Years ' War ended in 1648, and he again became more active in [[Loc265]]. His [[Loc265]] compositions during the Thirty Years ' War were, by necessity of the times, smaller scale than the oft-massive works before, although this period produced much of his most charming music. Additionally, the influence of the Netherlandish composers of the 16th century is prominent in his work. In some markets, particularly [[Loc72]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work. She won four medals in the world championships ; bronze medals in the combined ( 1985, 1987 ) and slalom ( 1989 ), and a gold medal in the combined at [[Misc152]] in 1989. He has worked as a school teacher, a speech writer in the office of the Prime Minister [[Per324]], and in musical theatre. before transferring to [[Loc266]] Grammar School as a boarder. In 1963, he obtained a position at [[Org181]], a private secondary school for boys, where he remained until the end of 1969. and Commodore International. He then spent several years as the manager of a small airline in Quirindi in country New [[Loc1]], where he also coached the local rugby team. He was soon after appointed as the Manager of Football Operations with the South [[Loc110]] Rabbitohs rugby league club, also without a fee. He cited ill health, however some news outlets have stated that it was a forced resignation after making controversial comments about [[Loc144]] Prime Minister [[Per325]] last year cost his breakfast program large sums of money from advertisers. In March 1995, he began a segment making editorial comment on the Nine Network 's \" Today \" breakfast show. Another possibility was Digital Research, who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as [[Loc267]], soon to become GEM. Between 1999 and 2000, the \" [[Org182]] \" investigation was conducted. While championing such authors as [[Per326]] Keepers [[Per327]], [[Per328]], and [[Per329]], he has criticized such authors as [[Per330]] and E. L. Doctorow. Much of it has appeared in \" The [[Loc268]] Review \". because he discovered that [[Loc61]] was n't so comparatively fantastic after all \". By 1985, CP / M was becoming increasingly outdated ; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Areas of impeded drainage sometimes harbor small wetlands, including non-forested seeps or forested wetlands with red maple ( \" Acer rubrum \" ), swamp white oak ( \" Quercus bicolor \" ), or black tupelo ( [[Per331]] sylvatica \" ). With the exception of the absence of certain prairie elements, the understories of these forests were generally typical of modern spruce-fir forests within and near [[Loc59]]. Temperate deciduous forests dominated from about 33 ° to 30 ° N. latitude, including most of the glacial [[Loc269]] from about 84 ° [[Per332]] longitude. [[Org183]] rivers in the ecoregion, such as the [[Loc270]], have been dammed. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the Commodore 64, but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. The archaeological site was fully excavated between 1950 and 1957 under the direction of [[Per333]], a local expert. He stepped down as president on December 31, 2009 and was succeeded by Dr. T. Alan [[Per334]]. \" Whoppers \" are malted milk balls covered with an artificially flavored \" chocolatey coating \" produced by The [[Org184]]. He saw service with the [[Org185]] and toured the [[Loc271]]. [[Misc153]] can both play back and record samples ; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels ; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. It is crossed by a number of footpaths leading between the [[Loc272]] and Commondale and other settlements to the south. One died on the [[Loc273]] in 1916 ( his body was never found ) and the other died of his wounds in 1920. He received his Ph.D. in 1957 from [[Org186]] of [[Loc274]] in [[Loc51]]. It is the 11th entry in the series released by [[Org187]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the [[Misc154]] uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. [[Per335]] 's favourite actors [[Per336]] and [[Per337]] acted in this film after \" Laawaris \". He was a World champion and a medalist at the World Rowing Championships. In the game the player controls a disgraced [[Misc155]] who must regain his honor by killing the humans who have stolen his technology. During gameplay, the [[Misc155]] generally emits lion, tiger, leopard, and jaguar growls. In 1989 magazines published a letter by Gilman [[Misc156]], head of Spectrum Holobyte. The [[Misc155]] then sets off his ship 's self-destruct sequence ; however, this fails to kill him as he is outside the range of the explosion. Shamed by defeat and having exposed his race to the humans, the [[Misc155]] is exiled by his clan to a planet inhabited by deadly alien creatures. Several other references to the film franchises are made throughout the game, including the appearance of [[Misc157]]. He reached the milestone in his nineteenth Test, scoring 137 against [[Loc39]]. Very early machines included the OS on a floppy disk due to it not being ready to be burned to ROM ( like the [[Misc158]] 1000 had ). Although his batting average during his captaincy was only slightly less than his career average, the [[Loc150]] only won one Test match and two ODIs out of thirty matches under his charge. This was also his 17th unbeaten test ton, a new record – one more than Indian legend [[Per338]] ( 16 unbeaten tons ). He rejoined his family in 1907, in Rehburg, and went to school in Wunstorf with his siblings from 1907 to 1912. With his younger brother [[Per339]] Jünger ( 1898 – 1977 ) he joined the \" Wandervogel \" movement in 1911. It was formed from the nationalisation of the \" Big Four \" British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail, in stages between 1994 and 1997. He spent his free time reading the works of [[Per340]], [[Per341]], Ariosto and Kubin, besides entomological journals he was sent from home. During 1917, he was collecting beetles in the trenches and while on patrol, 149 specimens between 2 January and 27 July, which he listed under the title of \" Fauna coleopterologica douchyensis \" ( \" Coleopterological fauna of the Douchy region \" ). He served in [[Misc26]] as an army captain. He met with LSD inventor [[Per342]] and they took LSD together several times. A process of dieselisation and electrification took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for the [[Loc275]] of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ). Together with Boreoeutheria, they make up [[Misc159]]. Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near-concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals : [[Loc276]], Boreoeutheria, and Xenarthra. He died in a Beaconsfield nursing home in December 1958, aged 81. Established in 1962, it is [[Loc277]] and [[Loc278]] 's oldest national park. On privatisation, responsibility for track, signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies. It is an affiliated member of [[Org188]].\n",
