Played by [[Per300]________] in his next appearance, with heavy make-up that makes him resemble an emaciated corpse, the Master returns in " [[Misc235]________] " ( 1976 ). From there, through [[Per311]________] ( [[Per312]________] ), the Master orchestrates the series of events that leads to the Doctor 's regeneration into his fifth incarnation ( [[Per313]________] ). However, as posited in the novelisation of the television movie by [[Per314]________], the Master 's self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a " morphant ". One of the most valuable products produced by [[Loc237]________] was the sap of the balsam tree, which could be made into perfume. However, the [[Misc234]________] finds his human host to be unsustainable as the body slowly begins to degenerate, although the [[Misc234]________] has the added abilities to spit an acid-like bile, both as a weapon and to mentally control victims as an alternative to his usual hypnotic abilities. As well as this, as foreshadowed in " [[Misc236]________] ", the [[Misc237]________] ( voice of [[Per315]________] ) gives the Doctor a message before dying : " You are not alone ". When the Doctor appears aboard the ship with the Master 's own future incarnation, he meets his successor, [[Per316]________] ( [[Per306]________] ), who is struggling between her nature and a promise to reform her ways. In the second part, the two [[Misc238]________] pair off as friends, but [[Per316]________] 's loyalties remain divided between the Doctor and her old self. By the 19th century, [[Loc237]________] 's fertility had disappeared. [[Per316]________] 's gradual reform is indicated in several more episodes. Trapped aboard the ship together, [[Misc239]________] finds her loyalties torn between her promise to the Doctor and the lure of her old self. Enraged at the idea of ever becoming the Doctor 's ally, the Master shoots [[Misc239]________] with his laser screwdriver, ostensibly disabling her ability to regenerate and killing her. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in " [[Misc240]________] ", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. King [[Per101]________] was said to have hidden from [[Per317]________] at [[Loc238]________] nearby. During the course of " [[Misc241]________] ", the Master unveils a new handheld weapon : a laser screwdriver. The screwdriver itself also contains isomorphic technology, a biometric security feature which effectively disables use of the device by anyone other than the [[Misc234]________].

The " Doctor Who " role-playing game published by [[Org241]________] in 1985 has two modules outlining the Master 's personal history, a timeline of his activities and an inventory of much of the equipment he has obtained during his travels.

Five days later, [[Org251]________] released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode ( which never aired ) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network ( first proposed by 19th century Prime Minister [[Per325]________] as early as the 1830 s ). In 1941, construction began on the second bridge between [[Loc256]________] and [[Loc257]________].

This fault is about long, situated mainly along the western base of the hills on the east side of [[Loc260]________]. It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the [[Loc261]________]. The [[Org254]________] has prepared ground shaking maps that include a possible concurrent scenario ( these are shown below ). It occurred on the southern segment of the fault, receiving its name ( some decades later ) from the nascent town of [[Loc262]________] where it was determined the quake 's epicenter was located. Conventional high-speed rail technology would be used as opposed to [[Misc249]________]. Numerous chemical, radiological, and biohazardous materials are present ( in relatively small quantities ) on campus and on the associated [[Org255]________], in the hills above the university. As that portion includes the so-called [[Loc263]________], the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The [[Misc250]________] website, in cooperation with the [[Org256]________], has prepared a virtual helicopter tour of the fault, with much additional information available through the tour. Like the other heralds at the [[Org257]________], the name is derived from the Canadian river of the same name.

While championing such authors as [[Per348]________], [[Per349]________], and [[Per350]________], he has criticized such authors as [[Per351]________] and [[Per352]________]. Much of it has appeared in " [[Misc267]________] ". because he discovered that [[Loc57]________] was n't so comparatively fantastic after all ". By 1985, [[Misc27]________] was becoming increasingly outdated ; it did not support sub-directories, for example.
